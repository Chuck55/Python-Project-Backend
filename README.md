This Project is the backend part of the react front end. Its testing out how to use marshmallow and sql alchemy in tandum to recieve data and save it to mysql databases. So far its just saving users and pokemon to databases

To run, you will need to install quart, and a couple other required classes. I ran using quart --app .\__init__.py run in the api/src/api folder. Not sure why it was created like that, but just working with it lol
